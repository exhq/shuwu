# shuwu
lightweight shitty shell written in go
# why?
my mom once told me "never fucking reinvent the wheel, unless you wanna learn how the wheel was made"  
she was drunk when she said this so idk
# when?
whenever im bored as fuck
# how?
the shell piggybacks off the actual shell, its kinda a wrapper for a shell? idk what to call it
